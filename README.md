Group Project

Apply the programming skills you learn in ASP.NET Core MVC by developing a
website called SportsPro Technical Support. This website is designed for the technical support
department of a hypothetical software company that develops software for sports leagues. The purpose
of the website is to track technical support service calls (referred to as incidents) in a database that also
stores information about the company’s customers, software products, and technicians.

The website
The SportsPro Technical Support website consists of web pages that support two types of users. First, it
lets administrators manage the products, technicians, customers, incidents, and product registrations
that are in the database. Second, it lets technicians update incidents that have been assigned to them.

The database
The database for the SportsPro website stores the data that’s needed to track technical support
incidents.
